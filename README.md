See myqueries.sql in week1 folder for sql queries I ran in pgadmin for homework 1 after using homework1.ipynb to load data to postgres.

See data engineering bootcamp homework2.docx in week2 for screenshots of my results from kestra ui. 
For question 3 I ran backfill for yellow data from 2020 Jan 1 to Jan 31 and then queried the row count (after truncating yellow trip data postgres table) . Same in question 4 but for green trip data.
For question 5 I just ran backfill for march 2020 after truncating the yellow tripdata postgres table and then queried the row count.
